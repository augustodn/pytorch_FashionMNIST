# Fashion-MNIST with Pytorch
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, 
associated with a label from 10 classes. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. 
It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

# Dataset Preview
This is a sample of how the data looks like in the original [dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

# Accuracy and Model Details
The model consists of two CNN layers with kernel size 5, activated by ReLU and Max Pool with kernel size 2. The last layer consist of a fully connected one with 7*7*32 inputs and 10 outputs, for
each class. Most of the details about it are clearly developed in this [medium](https://adenevreze.medium.com/cnns-with-pytorch-6cf7ed114af7) article. Also there are extensive notes 
in the jupyter notebook attached. This architecture, has about 90% accuracy obtained after only 6 epochs.
